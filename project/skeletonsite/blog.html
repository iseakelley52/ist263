    <h2>Will fast fashion ever stop if we can’t appreciate high quality goods?</h2>
    <p>
        The other day, while I was in class, I got a text from my mom with two Urban Outfitter’s links. “Eckhaus knock offs,” she said, presumably because they’re affordable dupes of one of my favorite brands, Eckhaus Lata. Eckhaus, easily recognizable for its unique patterns and prints, immediately caught my eye when working for a fashion boutique in Boston two summers ago. The owner of the boutique acted as a mentor for me when trying to figure out what I was passionate about and what I wanted to do; I credit her with my interests in sustainability (which started with fast fashion, but have since grown). <br>
        <br>
        As much as I liked the tops my mom had sent me, it also worried me that a store like Urban Outfitters was so easily copying trends from another designer brand. Not only did it worry me because Urban is one of the leading contributors in fast fashion, but it also posed the question, “is our generation desensitized from appreciating high quality goods?” <br>
        <br>
        I have always considered fashion to be somewhat of an art form – a way in which I can express myself freely and easily. My mom has always been ahead of trends, even when I was younger. Her appreciation for nice clothes taught me to prioritize quality over quantity in my wardrobe, which was sometimes hard as a Gen-Zer who was sucked into social media on a college campus with thousands of other students. <br>
        <br>
        Companies like Shein, Urban Outfitters and Pretty Little Thing dominate college fashion for the sole reason that they make “cute” clothes that are affordable for a lot of people. But the constant production of new items each week sets an expectation among teenagers and young adults of quick satisfaction. People grow tired of their clothes and constantly want to buy new, but will the ability to appreciate nicer items disappear if this is how we continue to shop? <br>
        <br>
        The catch is cost. With a demanding lifestyle for young adults, there is no way you can uphold health, school, and a job to make enough money to spend on sustainable pieces. That’s where ethical fashion comes in. You might be asking, “aren’t sustainable and ethical fashion the same thing?”. The nuances between the two are what could change young adult shopping habits. Sustainable fashion involves buying pieces made sustainably, using sustainable materials –100% cotton or cashmere instead of polyester. These typically cost much more and are difficult purchases for most people. But ethical fashion is where it gets easier. Instead of buying a lot of cheap items, buying one item that’s just a little bit nicer but costs a little bit more reduces waste and will last longer than the cheapest clothes. We continue the vicious cycle and fuel climate change. <br>
        <br>
        It’s taken me a while to pinpoint my style, but with basic pieces that are nice enough to last me years, changing up my style is pretty easy. My advice: start simple. To build your wardrobe to fit your style but also be sustainable, you have to start with the basics. Set a base layer, and work from there. Practice buying fewer items for as much as you’d spend on twenty items, and I bet you'll build your ethical wardrobe up faster than you think. <br>
