    <h2>Date</h2>
    <p>The past week has felt nostalgic while also optimistic. I’m at a stage where I’ve been away from home long enough where my friends and life in Syracuse feels like home, but that I’m also looking forward to starting new things this summer and maybe moving somewhere else. This week’s playlist has a different variety of songs, some empowering but sentimental – like Kacey Musgraves “Breadwinner” – while others are exciting and energizing – The Weeknd’s “Take My Breath.”</p><br>

    <p>
        Playlist:<br>
1. Breadwinner – Kacey Musgraves, star-crossed<br>
 Musgraves brings female empowerment to a new level with “Breadwinner,” a new hit off of her most recent album. The idea of men using women for their success, seemingly something Musgraves experienced before her recent divorce, along with a catchy melody, makes Breadwinner an immediate favorite for any feminist. <br>
2. uptome–LANY,ggbbxx<br>
 LANY was off of the grid for a while, but they’re back with another album which makes me fantasize living somewhere like, say, London. LANY’s sound isn’t anything new for them, but somehow each album is as good, if not better, than the last. <br>
3. Tyler Herro – Jack Harlow, That's What They All Say<br>
 I can say confidently that Jack Harlow’s That's What They All Say put him on the map the past year. Harlow’s clever lyrics and oozing confidence, obvious in every line, make “Tyler Herro,’ along with the rest of That's What They All Say, something I could listen to 24/7.<br>
4. Believe What I Say – Kanye West, Donda <br>
Anything that samples Lauryn Hill is on track to be amazing, but “Believe What I Say” brings Hill’s classic back to life. Donda stirred up controversy regarding its release date, but “Believe What I Say” makes up for it. <br>
5. Chill – Bakar, Chill <br>
 “Chill” immediately makes me feel like I’m driving in my hometown alone at night (something I did ocean, and probably every other suburban teenager when there was nothing be\er to do). Bakar successfully delivers a nostalgic feeling with his slow beats, but juxtaposed by his raw tone makes “Chill” fitting for many different occasions. <br>
6. Skate – Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak & Silk Sonic, Skate<br>
 Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak both have unique vocals, recognizable anywhere, and together it’s heavenly. They take you right back to the 60s and 70s with their beats and strings. Each verse is fairly chill, but the chorus is full of life and difficult to not dance to. <br>
7. Take My Breath – The Weeknd, Take My Breath <br>
The Weeknd’s newest single also takes you right back to the 80s with synths and the bass. “Take My Breath” is energetic and one of his most catchy tunes. Could it possibly mean another album soon? <br>
