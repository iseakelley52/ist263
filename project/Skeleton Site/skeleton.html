    <p>Hi! My name is Isea, and this is my BrianDump. <br> I’m a journalism and IT student, but I have a lot of opinions and can’t always share them. If you know me, you know I love to talk – and write, and create, and dish out my opinions. So that’s why I decided to make this platorm. A place where I can create content and deliver it, and hopefully you’ll get something out of it.</p>
