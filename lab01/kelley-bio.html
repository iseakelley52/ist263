    <body>
    I am currently a junior Newhouse iSchool dual major studying Magazine Journalism and IM&T with a concentration in Web Design. Writing is one of my strongest skills, but I love learning about design and behavioral content topics. Most recently I interned at Fidelity Investments as a content strategy intern under the marketing umbrella. During my time at Fidelity I focused on short-form content writing and behavioral science techniques, as well as participating in a design sprint with three other UX interns. Outside of work and school I love developing my graphic design skills and will occasionally create illustrative prints for my friends and others. Recently I have loved listening to podcasts (SmartLess with Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes is great). I live north of Boston, so during the summer I also spend a lot of time with my family and friends at the beach.
